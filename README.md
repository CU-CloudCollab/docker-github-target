# docker-github-target

This is an example GitHub repo that is configured with a deploy key. Because this is an example, this repo is public. Normally you wouldn't need a deploy key for a public repo. However, in a real situation, this repo would be private and the deploy key would be the only way to clone the repo.

This repo is used by the example in [docker-github](https://github.com/CU-CloudCollab/docker-github).
